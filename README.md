## Synopsis

This project enables you to estimate the number of equivalent complete generations (EqCg) (Biochard et al. 1997) for a set of individuals using their pedigree. The function requires the packages 'pedigreemm' (Bates and Vazquez, 2014) and 'nadiv' (Wolak, 2012).

## Motivation

This was initially created in order to estimate the effective population size based on pedigree, as shown by Leroy et al. (2013). Later it was shown that trends in EqCg over years can be used to determine if a breeding program has utilized a strategy that would lead to genetic gain over time (Rutkoski 2018).
